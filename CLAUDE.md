# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Haskell project built with Nix flakes for reproducible development environments and haskell.nix for building. The project follows strict code quality standards with comprehensive warning flags and formatting requirements.

This project is a web page generator for a Swedish bostadsrättsförening. When prompted to make a change to the site, always make the change in the Haskell generator.

DO NOT CHANGE DIRECTLY IN THE `web/` DIRECTORY

## Development Workflow

**ALWAYS run these commands after making changes to Haskell source:**
```bash
./scripts/format.sh
./scripts/verify.sh
```

These scripts ensure code formatting and successful builds. Never skip this step before committing changes.

## Development Commands

**Enter development shell:**
```bash
nix develop
```

**Build and run:**
```bash
nix run .
```

**Build with cabal (in nix shell):**
```bash
cabal build
cabal run brfteleterrassen1
```

**Live reload development:**
```bash
./ghcid.sh
```
Uses ghcid to watch for changes and rebuild/test automatically.

**Build Docker container:**
```bash
nix build .#container
```

## Code Quality Standards

**Formatting:**
- Always use ormolu for formatting (handled by `scripts/format.sh`)
- Never manually format - let the script handle it

**Warnings:**
- ALWAYS fix all compiler warnings - never ignore them
- Disable warnings in the cabal file's `common warnings` section, NEVER in source files
- The project uses `-Weverything` with specific exclusions for practical development

**Language Extensions:**
- Check the cabal file's `common extensions` section to see which extensions are enabled by default
- Current extensions include: OverloadedStrings, DuplicateRecordFields, NoFieldSelectors, StrictData, OverloadedRecordDot, AllowAmbiguousTypes, DataKinds, TypeFamilies, RecordWildCards, DeriveDataTypeable

## Architecture

**Project Structure:**
- `src/Main.hs` - Executable entry point that delegates to library
- `lib/` - Library modules with core functionality
- `scripts/` - Development automation scripts
- `flake.nix` - Nix flake defining the development environment and build

**Development Environment:**
- GHC 9.10.1 via haskell.nix
- Includes hlint, HLS, ormolu, and ghcid in development shell
- Comprehensive warning flags for strict code quality
- Uses GHC2021 language standard

**Dependencies:**
- Core dependencies: base, text, bytestring, async, unordered-containers
- Build tools: cabal, hlint, haskell-language-server available in nix shell

## Important Reminders

1. **Keep behaviour covered by automated tests; update coverage when behaviour changes**
2. **Always run format and verify scripts after changes**
3. **Fix all warnings - never disable them in source code**
4. **Use the cabal file to understand enabled language extensions**
5. **Enter nix develop shell for all development work**
6. **Use ghcid for continuous feedback during development**
7. **Run tests frequently - they should always pass**
8. **Test builds before committing any changes**
9. **NEVER make git commits - leave that to the user**
